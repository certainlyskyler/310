In this chapter, we explore three key aspects of constructing robust and maintainable code:
1. Refactoring: Enhancing code quality by systematically improving existing code without altering its external behavior.
2. Automation: Streamlining repetitive tasks through build automation, continuous integration (CI), and scripting. Automated pipelines ensure consistent, error-free processes.
3. RESTful APIs: Bridging systems using REST principles, including resource-based architecture, HTTP verbs, and statelessness. RESTful APIs facilitate seamless communication between applications.

These topics empower software engineers to create efficient, maintainable, and interconnected systems.
