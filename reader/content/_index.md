This is the course reader for CPSC 310 at the University of British Columbia.
This course is a comprehensive introduction to how modern software systems are designed, constructed, and evolved.
It is intended to be paired with a development-heavy project to better reinforce the core concepts from lecture materials and to enable concepts to be applied in practice.

The materials have been adapted over several years of use, although each section of the course may use different subsets of the readings and videos.
This is a high-level overview of what the course will be about.
The materials roughly break down into 6 high-level modules that are spread across the 13 week of standard academic semester at UBC.
Readings and videos are available for most course concepts.
